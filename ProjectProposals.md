# Project Proposals - Rafa - DSI 4


* Project 1: 
-----------------------
**Building an Attribution Based Impression Model**

Using the data from an ad agency, I can use attribution reports to turn around and build an impressio model.  This model, will most likely look like a multi-arm bandit problem.  Expected values of each ad will correspond to how likley a consumer is to convert after seeing the ad.  

I will present my work in a game-like fashion showing the next ad to show a user, if they haven't converted.  I would like to make it live using flask.

I will also use Prezi to present all relevant information.

I have my data, so my next step is finding the right methodology for creating priors.  I will need to collect impression information, but can easily get that as well.  

* Project 2:
--------------------------------
**Open Ended Employee Reviews**

I would like to create an interface for employers to write reviews for their employees and see, based on what they wrote, their employees 'grade'.  Doing this is tough, because grading employees is almost never advised for creating a positive atmosphere, so I think most of the problem is figuring out how to make this a productive method for feedback.  For now I will only focus on reviews, but I would like to try and make it more accurate and find areas for improvement.


The data will come from the same ad agency as my previous data.

I will make a flask web application and show the pros and cons of this system.
